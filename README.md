### Migration from the old dotnet-kit

Until November 2014, the dotnet kit was based on F# code. This introduced syntax that can be confusing or unnecessarily complex for C# developers.
F# users can stick with the older kit, but C# are strongly encouraged to switch to this kit. See [Migration.md](https://github.com/prismicio/csharp-kit/blob/master/Migration.md) document for more informations.
